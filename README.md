## how to make the best friggin' swiss potato soup you've ever eaten in your life

1. Take 3 potatoes, 1 onion, 5 strips of bacon, 1/3 a cup of flour, 2 cups of 2% milk, 3 cups of water, salt, pepper, and 1 cup of shredded swiss cheese.

2. cube the potatoes, dice the onions, and cut the bacon into 1/2 inch bits.

3. cook the bacon in a pot until cooked (i prefer it to be chewy) and put it aside.

4. put the potatoes and onions into the pot and cook it with the bacon drippings until the onions are browned.

5. add in the 3 cups of water, salt, and pepper. Bring it to a boil before then letting it simmer for 10-15 minutes

6. mix the 2 cups of milk with the flour in a separate bowl until the flour is thoroughly mixed in the milk.

7. add the flour-milk mixture to the pot along with the bacon that has been put aside. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir for 5 minutes.

8. Add in the 1 cup of shredded cheese in increments so that it evenly melts into the soup. You can serve once it has all melted.

9. IT IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!
